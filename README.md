# Group Project: WDI Conference Survey App
#### _Developed by Sandesh & Helmi_
---
## Technologies Used
### Front End:
* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript
* JQuery
* Skeleton
### Back End:
* Ruby On Rails
* PostgreSQL
## General Approach
First step that we did, was to brainstorm the user story and did a rough sketch of what our website would look like. We then wrote down the database table. After coming up with the database, we designed the wireframes and decided on what technologies we would use to make the app.
After we have all the components and ideas of how our website would look like, we then divided the task of building our website according to front end and back end design of the website.
## [User story](https://trello.com/b/98vGazhL/ga-conf-survey):
* As an attendee, I have to answer all the survey questions.
* As an attendee, I am unable to click submit if I missed out a survey question.
* As an admin, I am able to view the graphs for the survey submitted.
## Wireframes: Available in wireframes folder.
## Unsolved Problems or Major Hurdles:
* Using github branch files to merge files (i.e. conflicting file issues).
* Limited time to include admin login so that admin can log into website and see the graphs.
* Website is not properly in scope for mobile optimization.
* Layout of website need be more clean. (i.e. background picture and font clashed colours.)
